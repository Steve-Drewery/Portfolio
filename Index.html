    <p>I have recently started my coding journey studying at Coders Academy. Having no prior experience 
        it has been challenging although through sheer determination I am charging through and look forward to
        having a rewarding career at the end of my studies!

        I think the most enjoyment i get is from progression, with anything from studying, to working out, to playing video games.
        I am always happiest in those moments of 'I did it!'.
